## Feature Suggestion: Data Visualization in Shiny Dashboard for imputeTestbench
###  Introduction
The imputeTestbench package is designed to evaluate and compare different data imputation methods. Currently, users can only rely on statistical outputs to understand the impact of these methods. To enhance the user experience, I propose adding a Shiny dashboard that visually showcases data both before and after imputation. This feature will help users intuitively grasp how missing data is handled and how imputation methods influence their datasets.
###  Why We Should Implement This Feature

Clearer Understanding: Visualizing missing data and its imputed versions will provide users with a more intuitive understanding of imputation methods' effects.
Better Comparisons: Users can directly compare multiple imputation methods side by side through interactive plots.
User Engagement: An interactive Shiny dashboard will make the package more user-friendly and accessible, attracting a broader audience.
Data Transparency: Seeing how data evolves from raw to imputed states promotes trust in the applied methods.

###  How It Would Work

Data Input: Users upload their dataset via the Shiny interface.
Pre-Imputation Visualization: The dashboard will present histograms, scatter plots, and box plots that highlight missing data points.
Imputation Method Selection: Users can choose imputation methods (mean, median, kNN, etc.) from a dropdown menu.
Post-Imputation Visualization: Updated plots will display the data after imputation, allowing for direct before-and-after comparisons.
Before and After Comparison Page: A dedicated page within the Shiny dashboard will show side-by-side visualizations of the data before and after imputation. Users can toggle between different imputation methods to see how each one affects the dataset, with synchronized plots for easy comparison.
Metrics Display: Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) will be shown for both raw and imputed data.
Interactivity: Users can hover over plots for detailed data insights and zoom in on specific areas of interest.

### Impact of This Feature

Enhanced Decision-Making: Users will be able to make more informed decisions about which imputation method suits their data best.
Increased Package Adoption: A visually appealing and interactive dashboard will draw more users to the imputeTestbench package.
Improved Analysis: Researchers and data scientists can visually spot trends or issues in imputation results, leading to better model performance and insights.

### Conclusion 
Integrating a Shiny dashboard into imputeTestbench would elevate the package by providing an intuitive, interactive way to visualize data before and after imputation. This feature bridges the gap between statistical outputs and visual insights, making the imputation process more transparent and user-friendly.
Looking forward to feedback on this proposal and discussing how we can best integrate it into the package!
